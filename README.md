# Unexpected Output in Conditional Logic

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function that produces unexpected output under certain conditions.  The `foo` function aims to categorize numeric inputs based on their value (null, negative, or positive), but it contains a flaw in how it handles the input 0.

The bug is described in detail in the `bug.js` file and a corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  The issue lies in the comparison operator within the conditional statements which leads to unexpected results for the value 0.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and observe the existing code.
3. Run the code using a JavaScript environment like Node.js.
4. Note the incorrect output for the input 0.
5. Compare the output with the corrected version in `bugSolution.js`.
